    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The city is noted for its fine buildings and big shopping centers. I live in a double- storied house in Connaught Place, the ultra- modern market of the city. The window of my room faces a busy street. usually sit in my window and enjoy the view of the street.</p><br>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>The street is always full of people from the early hours of the morning. The confectioners and barbers have a rush of customers with the first rays of the sun. scooter, motor â€“ rickshaws, motorcars start plying up and down the street and fill the atmosphere with dust, smoke and noise. The newspaper seller and bread- seller also join the crowd.</p><br>

    </ol>
     
    <p>By nine o'clock the rush is it its peak. Thousands of people going to office are no the roads rushing to their place of business either on foot or no cycles. I see long queues of passengers waiting to board the bus as and when they arrive. By twelve o'clock the rush slows down. By about two in the afternoon the street looks completely deserted. Restaurants however, are still busy. There is a rush of customers.</p><br>
